"""
Strategy Implementations: Concrete walker implementations for different Dilts levels.

This module provides concrete implementations of DiltsWalker for different
levels of the hierarchy, each with appropriate autonomy and strategy generation.

Available Strategies:
    - MissionWalker: Level 6 (Mission) - Extreme autonomy, strategic decisions
    - CapabilityWalker: Level 3 (Capability) - Low autonomy, implementation choices

Example:
    >>> from sixspec.walkers.strategies import MissionWalker, CapabilityWalker
    >>> mission = MissionWalker()
    >>> capability = CapabilityWalker()
