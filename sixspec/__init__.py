"""
SixSpec: Six-Dimensional Specification Framework

A framework for building self-documenting, traceable specifications using
the Chunk model (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW, WHY) combined with Dilts'
Logical Levels for hierarchical organization.

Core concepts:
- Chunk: Six-dimensional object representing specifications
- Dimension: The six dimensions (WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW/WHY)
- DiltsLevel: Hierarchical levels from Environment to Mission
- BaseActor: Interface for entities that understand dimensions
- DiltsWalker: Hierarchical walker with WHATâ†’WHY propagation
- Workspace: Isolated execution environment for walkers
