# SixSpec Quick Start Guide

Get started with dimensional commits in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Install (30 seconds)

```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -c "from sixspec.git.parser import CommitMessageParser; print('‚úì SixSpec installed')"
```

## Step 2: Setup Git Hook (30 seconds)

```bash
# Copy the commit-msg hook to your repository
cp sixspec/git/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg

# Configure commit template (optional but recommended)
git config commit.template templates/.gitmessage

# Verify hook is installed
ls -l .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

## Step 3: Make Your First Dimensional Commit (2 minutes)

```bash
# Make a change
echo "# Test" > test.py
git add test.py

# Commit with dimensional format
git commit -m "test: add test file

WHY: Verify dimensional commit system is working
HOW: Created simple test file with git add and commit"
```

### What Happens

The git hook will:
1. ‚úÖ Check commit type is valid (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore)
2. ‚úÖ Ensure WHY dimension is present
3. ‚úÖ Ensure HOW dimension is present
4. ‚úÖ Accept the commit if all checks pass
5. ‚ùå Reject with helpful error if anything is missing

### If Validation Fails

```bash
‚ùå Invalid commit message format:
  ‚Ä¢ Missing required dimension: WHY

üìã Commit messages must include WHY and HOW dimensions.
   See .gitmessage template for examples.
```

## Step 4: Query Your History (2 minutes)

```python
from pathlib import Path
from sixspec.git.history import DimensionalGitHistory
from sixspec.core import Dimension

# Load your repo
history = DimensionalGitHistory(Path("."))

# See all commits
print(f"Found {len(history.commits)} dimensional commits")

# Query by purpose
for commit in history.query(why="verify"):
    print(f"‚úì {commit.object}")
    print(f"  WHY: {commit.need(Dimension.WHY)}")
    print(f"  HOW: {commit.need(Dimension.HOW)}")
```

## Common Patterns

### Bug Fix

```bash
git commit -m "fix: payment timeout issue

WHY: Users experiencing 25% cart abandonment due to API timeouts
HOW: Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts max)
WHERE: src/payment/stripe_integration.py"
```

### New Feature

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add search filters

WHY: Users cannot efficiently find products in large catalog
HOW: Implemented faceted search using Elasticsearch with category filters
WHERE: src/search/api.py, src/search/filters.py
WHO: All users"
```

### Refactoring

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation logic

WHY: Duplicated validation code across 3 payment providers
HOW: Created shared PaymentValidator class with common validation methods
WHERE: src/payment/validation.py, src/payment/stripe.py, src/payment/paypal.py"
```

### Documentation

```bash
git commit -m "docs: update API integration guide

WHY: Developers struggling with authentication flow (5 support tickets this week)
HOW: Added step-by-step guide with code examples and troubleshooting section
WHERE: docs/api/authentication.md
WHO: Third-party developers"
```

## Tips

### 1. Use the Template

```bash
# Load template in your editor
git commit --template=templates/.gitmessage

# Or set it as default
git config commit.template templates/.gitmessage
```

### 2. Optional Dimensions

Only WHY and HOW are required. Add others as needed:
- **WHAT**: Specific technical changes
- **WHERE**: Files or components affected
- **WHO**: Users or systems impacted
- **WHEN**: Conditions or triggers

### 3. Keep It Concise

```bash
# Good - clear and concise
WHY: Users abandoning carts due to timeout
HOW: Added retry logic with exponential backoff

# Too verbose
WHY: We noticed in our analytics dashboard that there has been a significant increase in cart abandonment rates, specifically around 25%, and after investigating the server logs we determined that the issue is related to API timeout errors occurring in the payment processing system...
```

### 4. Focus on Purpose

```bash
# Good - explains business value
WHY: Users cannot find products efficiently

# Bad - just repeats the change
WHY: Need to add search filters
```

## Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/git/test_parser.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/git/test_parser.py::TestCommitMessageParser::test_parse_valid_commit_minimal
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

```bash
# Check hook is executable
ls -l .git/hooks/commit-msg

# If not, make it executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg

# Check hook has correct shebang
head -1 .git/hooks/commit-msg
# Should show: #!/usr/bin/env python3
```

### Import Errors

```bash
# Reinstall in development mode
pip install -e .

# Verify Python can find sixspec
python -c "import sixspec; print(sixspec.__file__)"
```

### Invalid Format But Looks Correct

```bash
# Check dimensions are uppercase
WHY: (correct)
why: (incorrect)

# Check commit type is valid
feat: (correct)
feature: (incorrect)

# Valid types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
```

## Next Steps

1. **Read Full Documentation**: See `README.md` for complete API reference
2. **Run Demo**: `python examples/demo.py` to see examples
3. **Review Tests**: `tests/git/` for more examples
4. **Query Your History**: Use `DimensionalGitHistory` to explore commits

## Help

Having issues? Common questions:

**Q: Can I use this with existing repositories?**
A: Yes! Just install the hook. Old commits won't have dimensions, but new ones will. Use `skip_invalid=True` when querying.

**Q: What about merge commits?**
A: Merge commits are automatically skipped by the validation hook.

**Q: Can I temporarily bypass the hook?**
A: Use `git commit --no-verify` to skip hooks (not recommended for normal use).

**Q: Do dimensions need to be in a specific order?**
A: No, any order works. Only the subject line must be first.

**Q: Can I have multi-line dimension values?**
A: Currently single-line only. Keep dimensions concise.
